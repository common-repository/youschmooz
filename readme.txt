Schmooz, The next generation of online commenting.

== Description ==

Schmooz started out with one simple goal: to organize the hundreds of comments that were posted on a single webpage. With this in mind, it has shaped itself into an innovative new way of online communication. Designed by Dhruvil Patel and developed by the WebPlanex Team, Schmooz is here to change the way people communicate on websites.

Want to have your own separate conversation on a webpage? We let you do that.
Want to favourite a stream of comments so you can view it later? We let you do that as well.
Want to mention a friend on Twitter directly from a comment? Yes, you read that right.

Organized Commenting

Schmooz allows every user the ability to start their own conversation. Instead of one continuous stream of comments, users can distinguish between different conversations and reply in the ones they want to participate in.

View multiple Conversations

Not only do users have the ability to take part in more than one conversation, they can view two conversations on a webpage at the same time, making reading and replying to comments super efficient.

Instantly See What's Trending

Usernames of the people that have started a conversation are displayed in a box. The size of the username increases as more people post replies within that conversation. Now you can easily and intuitively see which conversation is trending on each page.

Mention friends on Twitter directly from a comment

Addicted to Twitter? We can relate. Thats why we made it possible for you to mention someone on Twitter directly through your comments or replies. You can also mention people that are signed up to Schmooz.
Type "@@" followed by someone's Twitter handle to mention them through Twitter. OR Type "@" followed by their Schmooz handle to mention them through Schmooz.

Favorite Conversations

See something funny, important or memorable that you want to remember for later? Just click the star to save the comment and all its replies as a favorite so you can check it out anytime from your Dashboard.

Colour coded Comments

Colour coded comments help distinguish the replies from comments and keep track of the conversation. As a website that uses Schmooz, moderators will have the option to pick any choice of colours to match your website's colour scheme.
